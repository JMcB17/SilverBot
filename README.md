This is the hosting guide and not the end user guide.  
Warning: This guide isn't finished at all.  
To run this you will need to install:
- .net 5 runtime (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- GDI+ (https://github.com/mono/libgdiplus if you aren't on windows)
- Java 13 (ikr)  
- A selinium compatible browser (chrome and firefox are implemented at the moment only and firefox is faster by a little bit)
You will also need:
- A discord **bot** token (https://discord.com/developers)
- A discord server you can set up roles in
- A discord webhook for logging
- A PostgresSQL server / Space for a database
- A way to run any version of lavalink
- Optionaly:
  - A giphy api token (https://developers.giphy.com/)
  - A FortniteAPI token (https://dash.fortnite-api.com/)
  - A topgg token that is a stored in the `connect.sid` cookie or an bot token
- Optionaly a friday text and voice channel  
The config will be automaticly generated and should automagically open in your prefered editor (windows only) (also lol if it opens in internet explorer its not my fault).   
The config should be self explanitory, just open it and enter the values there.
I know my variable names are crap but if you can make em better make a pull request.
